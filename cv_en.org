* Research Interests

  # My research interest is in OS kernel, virtualization technology, device driver layer, and firmware.
  # My research interests include operating systems, virtualization software, firmware security, and cloud computing.
  # In my past works, I mainly interested in thin-hypervisor which OS-independently runs without device virtualization.
  # I proposed a live migration scheme and a firmware protection scheme based on the thin-hypervisor to improve the serviceability of bare-metal instances in IaaS clouds.
  # I am also interested in light-weight nested-virtualization(2).
  # I am currently working on a VMM live refreshing with on-demand nested virtualization and new hardware emulation system for developing and evaluating applications.
  # In (1), I proposed an OS-independent live migration scheme without virtualization that the hypervisor carefully controlling physical hardware instead of virtualization.

  My research interests include operating systems, virtualization software, firmware security, and cloud computing.
  In my past research, I mainly worked on improving the serviceability of bare-metal instances in IaaS clouds.
  I proposed a live migration scheme and a firmware protection scheme for the bare-metal instances.
  In these works, I exploited a thin-hypervisor which OS-independently runs without device virtualization.
  I am also interested in light-weight nested-virtualization and contributed to (2) in this technical respect.
  I am currently working on a VMM live refreshing with on-demand nested virtualization, and on new hardware emulation system for developing and evaluating applications.


 # are for improving serviceability of bare-metal clouds, a IaaS clouds providing physical machines instead of virtual machines.
  # because bera-metal clouds does not allows device virtualization and adding dependency on guest OS, 
  # we proposed OS-independent schemes based on thin-hypervisor which does not almost hardware.
  # To improve serviceability and security of bare-metal clouds with keeping advantage of them,
  # we proposed methods achieving OS-transparency and without device virtualization and special hardware, by thin-hypervisor.
  # The thin-hypervisor based methods achieve new function by deeply control hardware independently on OS, instead of virtualize devices.
  
#   I am interested in controlling deeply and fully (sometime tricky) computer system in software layer facing hardware.
#   To achieve the control, I work on understanding hardware behavior deeply, sometime, beyond documented specification.
#   Controlling in low level software achieve OS and application transparency control with high privilege.
#   My past works achieving controlling commodity machines (i.e. PC architecture base computer with Intel architecture CPU) without special hardware.
#   My past research projects are the followings:
#   is mainly for clouds, especially bare-metal clouds.
  
  # - (1) Live migration in Bare-metal clouds. ::
  #      OS Live migration is a important function for IaaS serviceability.
  #      Live migration generally provided by VMM,
  #      while that incurs virtualization overhead and prohibits users to use hardware function such as RDMA directory.
  #      Bare-metal clouds are IaaS providing physical machines instead of virtual machines.
  #      In bare-metal clouds, the live migration is not supported due to lack of VMM.
  #      Previous works provides various live migration schemes without device virtualization.
  #      However, these schemes are not OS transparency, i.e. requires modification of guest OS or supporting special hardware functions.
  #      We proposed completely OS-independent live migration scheme for bare-metal clouds.
       
  # - (2) Hardware protection scheme for bare-metal clouds. ::
  #      Bare-metal clouds provide physical machine.
  #      The bare-metal cloud users can access the physical hardware directory from OS.
  #      This allows user to firmware access.
  #      If firmware is broken, the hardware cannot boot or the firmware may replaced with rootkit.
  #      So if malicious user attack the firmware, the cloud service will be corrupted. 
  #      To prevent this, we proposed protecting firmware by thin-hypervisor.
  #      The thin-hypervisor does not virtualize hardware, however block write accesses to the firmware.
  

  # - (3) On-demand nested virtualization scheme for live VMM refreshing. ::
  #      Generally, software rebooting is unavoidable event for security update and recover from memory leak.
  #      VMMs is no exception.
  #      However rebooting VMM cause stopping VM running on the VMM.
  #      In IaaS clouds, the VM stopping by vendor is unacceptable.
  #      To avoid VM stopping in VMM rebooting, cloud vendor can live migrate to the other physical machine before rebooting VMM.
  #      Live migration of VM heavily load network and requires additional physical machine.
  #      To avoid these things, previous research introduced nested virtualization techniques allowing multiple VMMs run on a VMM in a single physical machines.
  #      However, nested virtualization results constant performance overhead even if the system does not executing VMM rebooting process.
  #      To avoid nested virtualization overhead with keeping there advantage, we propose on-demand nested virtualization.
